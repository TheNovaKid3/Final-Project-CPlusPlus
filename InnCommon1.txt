You find yourself in the common's area of the inn. You look around and see someone waving their hands at you. It's your friend Christopher. You go over to him.
"Hey &! How are you?" Chris says to you in a excited manner.
A gruff "Fine" is your response.
"Hey you wnat to spar?" Chris asks you. Well that was completely out of left field.
What do you say?
1. "Sure."
2. "Of course."
... What? You want a negative answer? I'm sorry but why would you not want to Spar with you friend. Plus Chris is looking at you with puppy dog eyes. Can you really say no to that?&
"YAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY!!!!!" Chris says joyfully.&
"That was fun!" Chris exclaimed. You agreed. I do to. Sadly I am not finished with this. I hope to finish this at a later date. Thank you for playing.&
